            <h1>Content Accessibility Matters</h1>

            <p><img alt="A11yFirst University of Illinois Library Innovation Project logo" src="images/a11yfirst-mascot.png" style="float:right" />The A11yFirst for CKEditor project seeks to change the content authoring model into one where the authoring environment supports accessibility by default when creating or editing web pages using an embedded editor. As a result, website creators will be able to author accessible content without needing a deep understanding of the complex reasoning behind the current accessibility standards or the actual technical processes needed to implement those requirements.</p>

            <h2>Why fix problems after the fact when you can prevent them in the first place?</h2>

            <p>In the traditional way of doing things, many authors and editors create website content before considering accessibility, and then, after the content has been created, identify and address any accessiblity problems using either a manual or automated scanning tool.</p>

            <p>A11yFirst changes the paradigm by guiding authors through the process of making content accessible during the creation process, with features such as allowing only properly nested heading levels (currently available) and interactive queries for text alternatives for images and meaningful link text (coming soon).</p>

            <p><a href="http://ckeditor.com/demo">CKEditor</a>'s <a href="https://sdk.ckeditor.com/samples/accessibilitychecker.html">built-in Accessibility Checker</a> is still available, but it should identify many fewer issues in an A11yFirst-created page than in a native CKEditor page.</p>

            <h2>Special features in A11yFirst</h2>
