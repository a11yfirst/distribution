          <h2>Getting Started with A11yFirst</h2>
        </summary>

        <h3>What is A11yFirst?</h3>

        <p>Before you begin using the A11yFirst editor, it is important to know what makes it different from other editors. The name <em>A11yFirst</em> hints at some of these differences.</p>

        <p><em>A11y</em> is shorthand for <em>accessibility</em> (<em>a</em> + 11 letters + <em>y</em>), and accessibility in the context of document authoring is about making the information that documents contain perceivable and understandable by everyone, including people with disabilities.</p>

        <h4>Commitment to accessibility</h4>

        <p>Your organization, by hosting the A11yFirst editor within its content management system, has made a commitment to accessibility because (1) it removes barriers that people with visual, auditory, learning and other disabilities may experience in their use of web information and communication technologies and (2) it is required by law.</p>

        <p>By following accessibility guidelines when creating public-facing documents, you are fulfilling your role in this commitment.</p>

        <h3>Document accessibility</h3>

        <p>Some of the main components within a document that are important for accessibility are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Headings — These provide titles for the sections and subsections of content within your document, as well as a title for the document itself.</li>

          <li>Lists — By using the list feature, the items in a list are grouped together and information about the grouping can be conveyed to users of assistive technologies.</li>

          <li>Links — The text component of a link should describe its target, i.e., the web site, page or section that will be displayed if you activate the link.</li>

          <li>Images — When an image with informational content is included within a document, a short text description (also known as ‘alt text’) allows screen reader users to obtain a concise description of the image.</li>

          <li>Tables — By using the table feature to organize tabular data and provide row and column headers, users of assistive technologies gain the ability to easily navigate and understand structural relationships within the data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>A different way of thinking</h3>

        <p>The way you think about the process or workflow of creating and editing documents can make a significant difference in whether the end result, your finished document, is accessible.</p>

        <p>For example, rather than thinking about stylistic considerations such as font sizes and colors first, if you make the structure of your document a primary consideration, by breaking it down into sections and subsections and giving each of these a meaningful title, you will end up with a document that will be easier for all users to navigate and understand, including people with disabilities.</p>

          <h2>Inclusive Authoring: Creating Accessible Documents</h2>
        </summary>

        <h3>What is accessibility?</h3>

        <p>Accessibility, as it relates to a web document, is a set of features or qualities that enables all of the information contained in the document to be perceivable and understandable by all readers, including people with disabilities.</p>

        <p><strong>Important concept:</strong> <em>all</em> of the information -> <em>all</em> readers</p>

        <h3>Who benefits from accessibility?</h3>

        <p>In general, all readers of your document. Importantly, this includes people with disabilities such as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>blindness, other visual impairments</li>
          <li>deafness, hard of hearing</li>
          <li>cognitive impairments</li>
          <li>learning disabilities</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Who is responsible for the accessibility of a web document?</h3>

        <p>The author! Only you know what you are trying to communicate.</p>

        <h3>What makes a web document accessible?</h3>

        <p>Some of the more important features include:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Well-defined structure: use of headings and subheadings; appropriate use of lists and tables</li>
          <li>Text equivalents for images, audio, video</li>
          <li>Avoidance of using visual styling alone to convey structure or meaning</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>What is a text equivalent?</h3>

        <p>When a reader of your document is unable to see or hear non-text content such as an image or audio clip, a text equivalent provides an accessible description that conveys <em>all of the pertinent information that the visual or audio content would convey</em> to readers that do not have that particular disability.</p>

        <p><strong>Important concept:</strong> <em>equivalency</em> between the image or audio content and its text description</p>

        <h3>How to think about whether your document is accessible?</h3>

        <p>A couple of simple tests/thought experiments:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Turn off your monitor and imagine that you are relying on a screen reader<sup>[1]</sup> to understand what the document, including all of its images, communicates to its readers. Are you getting <em>all</em> of the information?</li>
          <li>Turn off your speakers and imagine that you are relying on captioning or a text transcript of the audio content to understand what the document communicates to its readers. Again, are you getting <em>all</em> of the information?</li>
        </ol>

        <p><sup>[1]</sup> A screen reader is an assistive technology that enables a person who is blind or visually impaired to obtain and interactively utilize an audio (via speech synthesis) or braille rendering of a document.</p>
