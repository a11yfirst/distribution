<h2>Health benefits of a high fiber diet</h2>

<p>Dietary fibers are found in fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Dietary fiber is found in plants, typically eaten whole, raw or cooked, although fiber can be added to make dietary supplements and fiber-rich processed foods. Grain bran products have the highest fiber contents, such as crude corn bran (79 g per 100 g) and crude wheat bran (43 g per 100 g), which are ingredients for manufactured foods. Medical authorities, such as the Mayo Clinic, recommend adding fiber-rich products to theStandard American Diet(SAD) which is rich in processed and artificially sweetened foods, with minimal intake of vegetables and legumes.</p>

<h2>Plant sources of fiber</h2>

<p>Some plants contain significant amounts of soluble and insoluble fiber. For example, plums and prunes have a thick skin covering a juicy pulp. The skin is a source of insoluble fiber, whereas soluble fiber is in the pulp. Grapes also contain a fair amount of fiber.</p>
