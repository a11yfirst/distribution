<h1>Human nutrition</h1>

<p>Human nutrition deals with the provision of essential nutrients in food that are necessary to support human life and health. Poor nutrition is a chronic problem often linked to poverty, food security or a poor understanding of nutrition and dietary practices. Malnutrition and its consequences are large contributors to deaths and disabilities worldwide. Good nutrition helps children grow physically, promotes human biological development and helps in the eradication of poverty.</p>

<p>The human body contains chemical compounds, such as water, carbohydrates, amino acids (in proteins), fatty acids (in lipids), and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). These compounds are composed of elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus. Any study done to determine nutritional status must take into account the state of the body before and after experiments, as well as the chemical composition of the whole diet and of all the materials excreted and eliminated from the body (including urine and feces). Comparing food to waste material can help determine the specific compounds and elements absorbed and metabolized by the body. The effects of nutrients may only be discernible over an extended period of time, during which all food and waste must be analyzed. The number of variables involved in such experiments is high, making nutritional studies time-consuming and expensive, which explains why the science of human nutrition is still slowly evolving.</p>

<h2>Average calorie consumption data</h2>

<p>The chart below, from the World Resources Institute, shows that from 1961 to 2010, the average number of calories consumed per capita per day for a variety of countries increased significantly. The United States and the European Union were at the top of the range, starting at around 3,000 calories per day in 1961, and ending at 3,700 and 3,400, respectively.</p>

<p>Brazil showed an increase from around 2,200 calories to 3,300, and China an increase from fewer than 1,500 calories to over 3,000, for that same span of years. The world average, as illustrated by the chart, started at around 2,200 calories in 1961 and ended at 2,800 in 2010.</p>

<p>The ranges in calories consumed per capita per day from 1961 to 2010 for the other countries shown are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nigeria: from 2,000 to 2,750</li>
  <li>Indonesia: from 1,800 to 2,750</li>
  <li>Japan: from 2,500, peaking at 3,000 in the late 1980's until around 1995, and then dropping off to 2,750</li>
  <li>India: from 2,000 to nearly 2,500</li>
  <li>Ethiopia: from 1,800 with considerable fluctuation through the early 1990's, and then increasing to 2,100</li>
</ul>

<p>The chart also projects increases of calorie consumption for all of the countries shown, from 2010 to 2050, with the world average starting at 2,800 and ending at 3,100.</p>
