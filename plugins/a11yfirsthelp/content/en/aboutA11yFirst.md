## About A11yFirst

### Project Description & Goals

The A11yFirst Project is a collection of modifications to CKEditor, an
HTML-embedded WYSIWYG editor typically used within content management
systems. Its goal is to make the process of creating and editing web documents
one that proactively results in accessible content.

In the past, authors have had to rely upon remediation tools used at the end
of the authoring process that ‘fix’ accessibility problems without offering
much guidance on how to prevent them. The A11yFirst editor takes a different
approach.

For example, by prompting the author to provide information regarding links
and images as they are added to the document, accessibility problems are not
only avoided, but authors learn on a feature-by-feature basis some of the
important requirements for accessible content.

Other design features in A11yFirst promote the use of blocks such as headings
and lists that carry with them semantics that are communicated to screen
reader users and that result in documents that are more easily navigated and
understood by all readers.
