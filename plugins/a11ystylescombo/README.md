# a11ystylescombo

The `a11ystylescombo` plugin was originally based on the `stylescombo` plugin.
It updates that plugin with the following modifications:

## Toolbar / Menu

* Menu button label changed to ‘Character Style’

* Menu eliminates block and object styles

* Located in the bottom row of the toolbar (for de-emphasis)

* Configuration: same syntax as `stylescombo` plugin

* Menu provides a Help menu item

## A11y considerations

* Visual styling alone should not be used in place of heading or list markup.
