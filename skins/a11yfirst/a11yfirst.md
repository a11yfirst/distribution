# Notes on maintaining the `a11yfirst` skin

* The `a11yfirst` skin is based on the `moono-lisa` skin.

* Our modifications are in `a11yfirst.css`, which is loaded by `editor.css`.

* See `a11yfirst.css` for further documentation on specific changes.

* The only `moono-lisa` file we have modified is `editor.css`. It loads one
  additional file: `a11yfirst.css`.
